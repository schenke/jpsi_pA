# jpsi_pA
This code computes the correlation of gluon (charged hadron) with J/Psi production at different rapidities, studying the effect of e-by-e fluctuations.

usage:
To generate the MV tables and then run the calculation:
./main
or
./main -readTable 0
To read in the MV tables from filw and then do the calculation (faster):
./main -readTable 1
